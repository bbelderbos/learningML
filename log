# 100 Days Of ML Code - Captains Log

## Day 1: FAugust 06, 2016

Today's Progress: I learnt about vectors, real coordinate spaces and how to add vectors algebraically and graphically. I also learnt how to multiply a vector by a scalar.


Thoughts: It was a really good start, happy I posted it on Instagram to keep me committed and I'll also be tweeting and logging it. Let's get it! 
Vectors are simple so far although I need to speed up my learning as I didn't get as far as I wanted to will continue in the moring, getting more of vectors done before work. 

## Day 2: August 07, 2016

Today's Progress: Continued working with Vectors, learn't about adding, subtracting and scaling them also how to determine the coordinates using magnitude and direct of two vectors.

Thoughts: The math is a little more challenging than I thought it would be, mostly because I'm brushing off a lot of cobwebs from math I haven't used E.g Trigonometry. 
Despite the math being a little more of a swallow learning curve than expected, I find myself really enjoying it. I regret not doing more of it in school. I get a real sense of achievement for working on it and it really excites me.

Some good resources I need to add to the repo are 1Blue3Brown. I love that guy, his enthusiasm and passion for his subjects really draw me in and motivate me to go on!
