# 100 Days Of ML Code - Captains Log

## Day 1: FAugust 06, 2016

Today's Progress: I learnt about vectors, real coordinate spaces and how to add vectors algebraically and graphically. I also learnt how to multiply a vector by a scalar.


Thoughts: It was a really good start, happy I posted it on Instagram to keep me committed and I'll also be tweeting and logging it. Let's get it! 
Vectors are simple so far although I need to speed up my learning as I didn't get as far as I wanted to will continue in the moring, getting more of vectors done before work.
