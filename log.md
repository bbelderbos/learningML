# 100 Days Of ML Code - Captains Log

## Day 1: August 06, 2018

Today's Progress: I learnt about vectors, real coordinate spaces and how to add vectors algebraically and graphically. 
I also learnt how to multiply a vector by a scalar.


Thoughts: It was a really good start, happy I posted it on Instagram to keep me committed and I'll also be tweeting and logging it. 
Let's get it! Vectors are simple so far although I need to speed up my learning as I didn't get as far as I wanted to will continue in
the moring, getting more of vectors done before work. 

## Day 2: August 07, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working with Vectors, learn't about adding, subtracting and scaling them also how to 
determine the coordinates using magnitude and direct of two vectors.

Thoughts: The math is a little more challenging than I thought it would be, mostly because I'm brushing off a lot of cobwebs 
from math I haven't used E.g Trigonometry. Despite the math being a little more of a swallow learning curve than expected, 
I find myself really enjoying it. I regret not doing more of it in school. I get a real sense of achievement for working on it 
and it really excites me.

Some good resources I need to add to the repo are 1Blue3Brown. I love that guy, his enthusiasm and passion for his subjects 
really draw me in and motivate me to go on!

## Day 3: August 08, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked further through Khan academenies linear algebra course, tested what I had been learning by
going through Andrew Ng's Linear alegra section of his course and bang I was doing  a lot better than my first attempt.

Thoughts: I realised today, more so than previous days that I am on a crunched timeline. Thus I need to learn only what I need to 
learn, so instead of meticulously working through each subject of math I need to cover. I should be stream lining it to what I need
for Machine learning. Hence, why I decided to attempt Andrew Ng's Linear Algebra portion of the course.

I am going to update the Math sections with the specific subject matter I find you need to know for each umbrella subject of math. 

## Day 4: August 09, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on week on of Andrew Ng's course, finding that the first 2-3 days I spent on linear algebra really helped me
understand not just the concept of linear regression but also with maths in general. 

Thoughts: Andrew has a great way of explaining things, I just need to be paitent. I think in my first attempt I was not paitent 
enough and tried to rush through the course. 

Each day I've been spending around 2 - 3 hours studying which is right where I want to be on week days. Weekends I can hopefully 
ramp up. 

## Day 5: August 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through Andrew Ng's course got through gradient descent. 

Thoughts: I know it's going to get harder, but I'm really happy with my attention to detail and how I am working through the
the problems. My note taking is great and I'm being paitent which I need to continue reminding myself to do.

## Day 6: August 11, 2018

Today's Progress: Had my first quiz in the course, got 4/5 the first time and then quickly worked through my notes and got
5/5 the second time around. 

Thoughts: Again I know it is going to get harder but the progress from my first failed attempt to now is great! I'm concerned
my python skills are going to drop off while I'm working through the math so I'm ensuring I'm doing pybites challenges and 
trying to help other learners.

## Day 7: August 12, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Week 2 of Coursea course and working through matrices multiplication. 

Thoughts:Short day, with city to surf run. Looking forward to smashing through this week and really testing where I am. 

## Day 8: August 13, 2018

Today's Progress: Powering through week 2, finished all the multivariate section. 

Thoughts: I will need to review matrices on Khan academy tonight to make sure I understand how matrices multiplication works. 
I am also hoping to get through to week three so that I am still on track with calculus. I've definitely changed my structure in terms of what is working best. Rather than purely learning the maths, I'm finding it best to go through Andrew's course and then supplement math when I don't understand. This allows me to just learn what I need to learn cutting down a lot of time and helping me focus on what's important. 

## Day 9: August 14, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 all done from a maths stand point, only the octave videos to go through

Thoughts: Although I know Python is the main programming language for ML, I'm excited to get a look at another languages syntax. Math keeps being exciting to me, I often consider doing some part time study for it just not sure if that is where I should be investing my time. 

## Day 10: August 15, 2018

Today's Progress: Quiz passed, took until attempt 3 to get 5 out of 5 and I know I will fail but I won't ever quit.

Thoughts: Really happy I passed was concerned about linear alegra. Although I think I have only touched the sides of the course, my main aim is to get to where I am training my own models as quickly as possible as that is how I learn best. 

I may have said this already but 3Blue1Brown is such a fantastic resources, that dude is amazing. 


## Day 11: August 16, 2018

Today's Progress: I had to revisit Octave, the syntax wasn't clear 

Thoughts: I definitely rushed through that section, key learning and I keep saying this is been patient. If I look at how far I've come from day 1 it is already crazy progress so no need to rush obviously this is longer than a 100 day journey it will gone on long after I've finsihed my 100 day log. 

Looking forward to the weekend with friends, although a little melancholy I won't be able to dedicate 8 hours + to ML. I will still get my 1-2 hours in. 

## Day 12: August 17, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished going through Octave at the airport

Thoughts: THe syntax is fine as always you have to google things and look up the documentation as you go. Won't get heaps donw over the weekend as I'm catching up with the guys in Melbourne. 

## Day 13 & 14: August, 18 & 19, 2018

Progress: Spent time just going through Sentdex starcraft tutorial as that is the area of deep learning the excited me to get into Machine learning

Thoughts: A lessoned learned for this up comming weekend in which I have Pycon AU I need to get up early to go through my study so that I can also enjoy Pycon with out worrying where I will fit the time in for study. 

## Day 15: August 20, 2018

Today's Progress: Assignemnt done (except the optional part which I will do during the week) onto week 3 Logistic regression

Thoughts: Often I feel like I'm not getting anywhere or learning what I should be. I constantly struggle with the thought of trying another course and then may be it will all click. But I need to keep reminding myself that before I started I wasn't sure what gradient descent was or what logisic regression was. Paitence, Paitence and Paitence is what I need to keep preaching to myself. 

## Day 16: August 21, 2018

Today's Progress: Started on Classification and logistic regression. Within that I learnt how to represent the hypothesis which is different to logistic regression as we now use the sigmoid function. I also learnt about the decision boundary which is essentially the line that seperates the area where y=0 and where y=1. Now I am working on the cost function of linear regression. 

Thoughts: I haven't really felt like I don't understand anything in the course yet. I think it is more the granularity that I don't have particularly with the maths. I am giving strong consideration to taking the udacity maths for machine learning course in parallel to the current course. 

It is important to not have limiting thoughts, I keep it positive and reinforce it by telling myself anyone can learn this and I just have to break it down into a way I understand. 

Machine learning and AI has me so excited for my future and while I still love marketing the dream would be to find a nice cross over point. 

## Day 17: August 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through week 3, primairyly on advanced optimisation and multiclass classification. 

Thoughts: Was a bit tired today and my mind kept jumping around, I know I will get there and I have come so far there is just always that little bit of doubt in the mind. 

## Day 18: August 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished part 1 of week 3 and bombed the test. Not sure if it was because I was rushing or because I didn't understand the course material.

Thoughts: The concept of Machine learning and in this instance classification is fine I feel like I understand what the algorithm is trying to achieve and why. 

What I need to better understand and be more confident in is reading the equation. I'm going to devert more time on math than I have been to ensure I understand what is happening so that when I hit the tests, I'm not uncertain about what is happening. I'm also going to spend a little bit of time on the forums also to see if others are running into the same issues and then see how they solved them.

## Day 19: August 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent time on Linear Algebra and watching sentdex star craft tutorial

Thoughts: By the end of the working week I'm pretty tired, I really notice it  by how deep of a sleep I am in when I wake up. I'm thinking I need to do some push ups or something to get my brain humming. 

The more I think about I think I need to be working on a project that excited me, sentdex made a fantastic point that one of the best ways to learn about anything is start and when you don't know what something is, go away learn it and then come back and see if you understand it. I guess that is sort of what I am doing right now with AN's course. 

I'm thinking about building my own card game and getting my deep learning machine to play games against itself. Although maybe to start I'm better off starting with some Atari games. 

One of my 100 days of code responders, had a great thought - 'Progress is progress'. 

## Day 20: August 25, 2018

Today's Progreess: Went to Pyconau today and listened to some interesting talks on how Python is used in Games, using Python to automate excel and how machine learning is effecting art. 

Thoughts: The artwork talk blew my mind and continued to inspire me to learn machine learning. The speaker talked about GANs and transfer learning to create otherworldly images. I'm definitely going to try this on a data set. 

## Day 21: August 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Pyconau Day 2, heard some more interesting talks and worked on my 100 days of code book

Thoughts: The talk by Tracy really inspired me to try and learn by doing and be happy to fail which I think I am after getting started on my book. It also made me realise I need to find a corner stone project for my machine learning - I am leaning on a Deep learning bot and making a chatbot using south park scripts probably Cartman, which I think would make a great tutorial. 

## Day 22: August 27, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I set up the Kanban post it note system to help me stay on task, I also did some more Vectors study. 

Thoughts: Setting up the Kanban with key learning objects will help speed up my time I need to learn the math of machine learning by keeping me on task.I also left my keys at home the one night Rosie wasn't home before me and was actually at the movies until 9pm! So I sat in Grilld and read an 'introduction to machine learning with python' which had some interesting points binary classification and what overfitting and underfitting are. The later was really interesting as we I worked in consulting I'd hear the analyst talk about ti but I never truely understood what they were talking about now I do :). 


## Day 23: August 28, 2018

Today's progress: Today I continued with the coursera ML course, I passed the WK 3 half way quiz although I found it quite difficult and only got 4/5 so some work needs to be done to better understand logistic regression. I then moved onto part 2 of week 3 overfitting and regularisation. 

Thoughts: Supplementing my work with the ML book was really helpful, reading about over fitting before I actually tackeled it in the course was really helpful in me understanding the topic. Regularisation is the next thing I need to read up about. On a side note the 100 days of code book is up to 13 people committed to helping +1 if you include Glyn but I doubt he does it. 


## Day 24: August 29, 2018

Today's progess: Two sections of overfitting and regularisation done. Making sure I take good notes and that I understand the content as best I can. 

Thoughts: I need to supplement more of my learning, going to get some OCdevL syllabus materials and share those with my instagram followers. The course what give me everything I need as I am quite far behind in terms of the knowledge I need from this field. Thus I need to use other resources to beef out my learning.  

## Day 25: August 30, 2018

c Completed the regularisation quiz on my second attempt, I feel I understand overfitting and underfitting well. I also started the week 3 assignment and had no idea what I was doing! 

Thoughts: I'm not sure if it is the octave syntax or my just not learning the materials well enough but I sturggle to do the assignments. I took something from rewatching Jabrils how to learn machine learning video and that was, when I don't understand something - I should go and research it independently until I do understand it. 

## Day 25: August 31, 2018

Today's progress: Continued with the quiz, but this time I'm writing out my solutions in my notes and making sure I really understand what is happening with the code and as yesterday mentioned, when I don't understand something I make sure I go and research it independently so tomorrow I am going to look into what transpose is and thus do more work on linear alegbra. 

Thoughts: I wanted to rush through and get to deep learning as quick as possible, unfortunately I am going to have to take my time a little more to make sure I understand the concepts. The postive of this is I can keep all those notes in my onenote and book and then write about them to help others, hopefully I can be a bit of a pioneer in the space (no coding and no machine learning/math of machine learning knowledge) and thus encourage others to give it a go. 

## Day 26: September 1, 2018

Today's progress: Not huge amounts of progress today I spent most of the morning understanding what is happening in 1.2.2 of the assignment. Determined to do more of it tomorrow. 

Thoughts: I had a great time walking with my partner and her friends from the split bridge to Manly. Getting outside and doing positive things for myself is so rewarding. I also had the chance to chat to Darren someone who has just completed their masters in computer science majoring in ai. He gave me some fantastic insight and the chat really excited me, which is a real positive in my mind as I was passionate and keenly interested in what he had to say about the field. It really hit home for me that this is an area I am deeply interested in and want to become more involved in. 

## Day 27: September 2, 2018

Today's progress: Again not a lot of progress today a little more work on the assigment.

Thoughts: I'm letting myself down on the weekends and I think it's potentially because I'm telling myself I will have all day to study. Instead I need to be coming into the weekend with a plan of what I need to learn and the goals for that learning. So right now I know I need to better understand how gradient descent, cost function all work to produce what we are doing in octave. I have some books to supplement that now. 

## Day 28: September 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment was hard! Also found this awesome series on logistic regression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5cNN2-HWE.

Thoughts:
