# 100 Days Of ML Code - Captains Log

## Day 1: August 06, 2018

Today's Progress: I learnt about vectors, real coordinate spaces and how to add vectors algebraically and graphically. 
I also learnt how to multiply a vector by a scalar.


Thoughts: It was a really good start, happy I posted it on Instagram to keep me committed and I'll also be tweeting and logging it. 
Let's get it! Vectors are simple so far although I need to speed up my learning as I didn't get as far as I wanted to will continue in
the moring, getting more of vectors done before work. 

## Day 2: August 07, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working with Vectors, learn't about adding, subtracting and scaling them also how to 
determine the coordinates using magnitude and direct of two vectors.

Thoughts: The math is a little more challenging than I thought it would be, mostly because I'm brushing off a lot of cobwebs 
from math I haven't used E.g Trigonometry. Despite the math being a little more of a swallow learning curve than expected, 
I find myself really enjoying it. I regret not doing more of it in school. I get a real sense of achievement for working on it 
and it really excites me.

Some good resources I need to add to the repo are 1Blue3Brown. I love that guy, his enthusiasm and passion for his subjects 
really draw me in and motivate me to go on!

## Day 3: August 08, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked further through Khan academenies linear algebra course, tested what I had been learning by
going through Andrew Ng's Linear alegra section of his course and bang I was doing  a lot better than my first attempt.

Thoughts: I realised today, more so than previous days that I am on a crunched timeline. Thus I need to learn only what I need to 
learn, so instead of meticulously working through each subject of math I need to cover. I should be stream lining it to what I need
for Machine learning. Hence, why I decided to attempt Andrew Ng's Linear Algebra portion of the course.

I am going to update the Math sections with the specific subject matter I find you need to know for each umbrella subject of math. 

## Day 4: August 09, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on week on of Andrew Ng's course, finding that the first 2-3 days I spent on linear algebra really helped me
understand not just the concept of linear regression but also with maths in general. 

Thoughts: Andrew has a great way of explaining things, I just need to be paitent. I think in my first attempt I was not paitent 
enough and tried to rush through the course. 

Each day I've been spending around 2 - 3 hours studying which is right where I want to be on week days. Weekends I can hopefully 
ramp up. 

## Day 5: August 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through Andrew Ng's course got through gradient descent. 

Thoughts: I know it's going to get harder, but I'm really happy with my attention to detail and how I am working through the
the problems. My note taking is great and I'm being paitent which I need to continue reminding myself to do.

## Day 6: August 11, 2018

Today's Progress: Had my first quiz in the course, got 4/5 the first time and then quickly worked through my notes and got
5/5 the second time around. 

Thoughts: Again I know it is going to get harder but the progress from my first failed attempt to now is great! I'm concerned
my python skills are going to drop off while I'm working through the math so I'm ensuring I'm doing pybites challenges and 
trying to help other learners.

## Day 7: August 12, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Week 2 of Coursea course and working through matrices multiplication. 

Thoughts:Short day, with city to surf run. Looking forward to smashing through this week and really testing where I am.
