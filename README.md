# Learning Machine learning in 100 days
This is my curriculum for learning Machine Learning, built from Siraj Ravals #100daysofMLcode. The curriculum starts from scratch in terms of Math, however assumes some python knowledge.

I am going to be documenting my journey you can follow along on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pinos/) and on [plant based programmer](http://plantbasedprogrammer.com/).


## Math

Useful resource: [Understanding math](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math.html)

### Linear Algebra: Days 1-7 

Firstly jump into Andrew Ng's course and see how far you get before you jump into the linear algebra resources. This lets you measure what you don't know and how much you have to improve.

1. Andrew Ng's course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) see how far you can get in week 1 before needing to check out the below two links 
2. [Khan Academy Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
    - Vectors 
    - Lineraly Independent
    - Matrices
3. [MIT Opencourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)

### Calculus: Days 8 - 14

Again using two main resources.
1. [Khan Academy Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/multivariable-calculus)
2. [3Blue1Brown video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

### Probability: Days 15 - 21

1. [Khan Academy Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability)

### Optimization/Algorithms: Day 22 - 28

1. [Khan Academy Optimization](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-diff-analytical-applications-new/ab-5-11/e/optimization)
2. [Edx Algorithm Design](https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-analysis-pennx-sd3x)


## Machine learning Intro's


### Intro course's to ML: Day 29 - 42:

1. [The Master Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
2. [udacity intro to machine learning](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)

### First Machine Learning Projects: Day 43 - 56

1. (TBC) 



## Deep Learning

### Intro to Deep learning/AI: Day - 57 - 70

1. [Fast AI Course](http://course.fast.ai/)

### Deep learning projects: Day 71 - 100

1. Chatbot
2. Sentdex Starcraft AI
